[//]: # (This project is a slight customization based off of some great work by [NC State University Libraries](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/. )
I am a PhD student at the [Audio Information Research Lab](https://labsites.rochester.edu/air/), University of Rochester, working with [Prof. Zhiyao Duan](https://hajim.rochester.edu/ece/sites/zduan/).
Take a look at [my CV](./You_Neil_Zhang_CV_2022_Nov.pdf).

My research interests lie in speech and audio processing for virtual and augmented reality.
My recent work has focused on **personalized spatial audio, synthetic speech detection, and audio-visual rendering and analysis**.
In my spare time, I am fond of movies, paddle boarding, and traveling.

If you are interested in my research, 
or would like collaborate with me, you are welcome to email me.
