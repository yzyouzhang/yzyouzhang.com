[//]: # (This project is a slight customization based off of some great work by [NC State University Libraries](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/. )
I am a PhD student at the [Audio Information Research Lab](https://labsites.rochester.edu/air/), University of Rochester, working with [Prof. Zhiyao Duan](https://hajim.rochester.edu/ece/sites/zduan/). Take a look at [my CV](./You_Neil_Zhang_CV_2023_Nov.pdf).

My research interests lie in speech and audio processing for virtual and augmented reality.
My recent work has focused on **audio deepfake detection, personalized spatial audio, and audio-visual rendering and analysis**.
In my spare time, I am fond of movies, paddle boarding, and traveling.

If you are interested in my research or would like to collaborate with me, you are welcome to email me.


### News
[2023/11] I sat down with Berkeley Brean at News10NBC to talk about audio deepfake detection.
